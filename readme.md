Currently, this is more an experiment that's still in progress to get into Rust and its ecosystem rather than an actual project.

But it reached a state where most of its features work, so maybe someone will find it useful or wants to contribute.

Also, this is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/xvxx/deadwiki">deadwiki</a>, so please have a look at this project!
